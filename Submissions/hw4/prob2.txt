Image Used: eye50.bw

1. Over what scale factors are the various kernels acceptable?

    Box:            Acceptable from 1 to 4  (50x50 to 200x200)
    Triangle:       Acceptable from 1 to 6  (50x50 to 300x300)
    Cubic:          Acceptable from 1 to 8  (50x50 to 400x400)
    Lanczos:        Acceptable from 1 to 10 (50x50 to 500x500)
    Hann:           Acceptable from 1 to 10 (50x50 to 500x500)
    Hamming:        Acceptable from 1 to 10 (50x50 to 500x500)

2. Describe the artifacts that appear, including their location and structure.

    As the image gets bigger via the scale factor the artifacts stand out more. 
    These small square artifacts occur at different color transitions. For example, 
    in the eyes50.bw the color transition from the women's eyes to the outer skin is a 
    good example of where these artifacts become noticeable.

/**************  Minification  ***********************/

Images Used: star.bw and ramp.bw

1. Compare the results between the point sampling (nearest neighbor) and a higher quality filter when minifying star.bw or ramp.bw.

    For the image ramp.bw all the kernels produce similar results and there are no sudden changes that could be observed. 
    The histograms stay the same with little changes. For the image star.bw, when minifying it from (512x512) to (200x200)
    we can observe that point sampling produces a minified imaged with distorted details on the background. 
    This can be noticed if we observe the circles close to the radius. The higher quality filter does not show this distortion because they blur this into the image. 

2. Why does point sampling work well for the ramp.bw image and not for star.bw?

    Point sampling does not work well for star.bw because there is not a smooth color transition. The rings change from
    white to dark very quickly for the inner circles and thus when we minify this image we are losing all this information. 
    Point sampling works well for ramp.bw because of the smooth color transition. When we minify the image and lose 
    some of the information this is not very apparent to the eye because it only makes the transitions between the colors faster.
