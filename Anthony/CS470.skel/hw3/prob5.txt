A) The Fourier transform of an impulse function is a constant value on every frequency. 

B) Yes according to our magnitude spectrum it shows that the FT of this filter is a sinc function. 

C) In the spatial domain the box has gotten wider. However, when we go take its FT we see that 
the sinc function gets narrower. Therefore, the spatial domain and frequency domain are inversely 
proportional. 

D) Constant value on the spatial domain will give an impulse in the frequency domain at f=0. 
Since there is no frequency, then the only component contributing is 0. 

E) The difference is the two spikes that the individual FT of cos produces. This example is testing
the additive property of FT. The individual FT of a box plus a cos is the same as adding them together 
or individually. 

F) B(x) will now be a taller box which on the frequency domain translates to the sinc function getting taller as well by
the same amount. Thus, if we scaled the input on the space domain it also gets scaled on the frequency domain. 

G) Shifting G(X) to the right by 16 does not change the magnitude spectrum, but the phase spectrum appears to have shifted.

H) The magnitude spectrum stays the same since the input was only shifted. The phase spectrum has shifted.
